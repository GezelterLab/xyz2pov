xyz2pov is a program which translates standard xyz trajectory files 
into scripts which can be rendered with the ubiquitous PovRay 
rendering engine.

We have compiled the source code on Linux and Mac OS X with no problems.

preferences. If you wnat to fiddle with the compiler flags, you can
edit them in the Make.conf file. Otherwise simply give them to
configure when you run the script.

Next simply run:

	make

This will compile all of the source files. To install them into the
xyz2pov's home directory run:
	
	make install

Finally:
	
	make links

The -a flag will output the atoms into the povray scripts. For a full
description of all of the flags, run:

	xyz2pov -h
